(c) Training MSE: 1.535095636242088
(d) Test MSE: 1.75433086109485 
(e) Your answer: The test MSE is smaller than the variance of y_test. This shows that the model explains a lot of the variability in the response variable. The model has reasonable predictive power.

Feature 1: Salnty Depthm (coef: 147.569766)
Feature 2: Salnty Dry_T (coef: 35.153778)
Feature 3: Salnty O2ml_L (coef: 32.217666)

(c) 
Feature 1: Depthm (coef: -146.550613)
Feature 2: O2ml_L (coef: -37.244657)
Feature 3: Dry_T (coef: -34.383804)

(d) y-intercept: 11.607865265528682

(c1) Best hyperparameters: 
* strategy: median
* poly degree: 3
* n neighbors: 10
* weight: distance
(c2) Best MSE: 1.1942865460094276
(d) Time: 83.12749290466309
(f) test MSE: 1.2398437245052845 
(g) Your answer: The test MSE is lower in this model, therefore this is the better pipeline than the linear regression. It has better predictive performance for water temperature. 

(5) - (Repeat of (4) with RandomizedGridSearch)
(c1) Best hyperparameters: 
* strategy: mean
* poly degree: 3
* n neighbors: 10
* weight: uniform
(c2) Best MSE: 1.2832593203192033
(d) Time: 13.211056232452393
(f) test MSE: 1.3121145795554305 
(g) Your answer: When using Randomized Search, we had a lower test MSE than the pipeline from part 2. This shows that it improved predictive performance for water temperature. 
(h) Your answer: Grid Search had a slightly better model with a lower test MSE, but it required much more time to compute. Randomized Search was much faster and had a MSE pretty close to the Grid Search. This demonstrates a trade off.

(b1) Training MSE: 7.21400727093023e-13
(b2) Test MSE: 1.4623776711365377 
(c) Your answer: When including extra variables, it does not improve preditive performance. The test MSE is a little bit higher than the pipeline that only uses numerical variables. This shows that the predictive power comes from the numerical variables.

(b) Your answer: One think that I learned about with pipelines is that you can do a DecisionTreeRegressor. This can find complex nonlinear relationships in your data. This is a really cool tool that you can use that I had no idea about!
